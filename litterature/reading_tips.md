# How to find & read academic literature

Notes from lectures:

- How to read an academic article (MSc. Computer Science course Advanced Software Engineering), given by Yvonne Dittrich
- Scientific Litterature & how to find it (MSc. Computer Science course Advanced Software Engineering), given by Paolo Tell

OBS! I gave Paolo's lecture the subheading "& how to find it" myself, to underline what the content was about.

## Finding academic litterature

- What makes litterature academic is the extesive process of ensuring the quality of the piece
- It should systematically stand on the shoulders of giants

### what is academic literature

- published in academic venues
  - conferences (e.g. FOSE - Future of Software Engineering)
  - articles
  - books
  - journals
  - (workshop)
  - (magasines)
- Academic orginasations
  - IEEE
  - ACM
  - IFIP

### Evaluating quality

- Aamount of citations
- Publisher
- Author
  - h-index (means x many publications, with at least x many citations - e.g. 77 many publications, that has eachbeen cited at least 77 tiems by other publications)
  - 10-index (number of an author's publications that have received at least 10 citations)
  - total amount of citations
- age of the paper

### Searching

- To be able to access extensive amount of literature on [the royal library](https://www.kb.dk/), go to KU or the black diamond, where access is IP based
- when searching (e.g. on google scholar) include the keyword "review" to find litterature review articles that summarize and discuss litterature on the specific area
- when searching for key words (e.g. on google scholar) you can put key phrases in quotations to treat it as a single token
  - e.g. `"software engineering"` would yield articles like `**Software engineering** practices` or `global **software engineering**`
  - where `software engineering` could yield something like `**Software** development and **engineering** parctices` or `**software** process leaving the **engineering** industry in...`

#### Websites (For computer science literature)

- [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
- [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/)
- [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)
- [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/)
- [Springer](https://www.springer.com/gp)
- [Danish Royal Library](https://www.kb.dk/)
- [Local Library (Copenhagen)](https://bibliotek.kk.dk/)

### Citing articles

- Do not use google scholar to copy citations
  - it is very error prone
- Gather citations in Zotero and use it with a browser extension tool that finds citations on pages for you

### Good tools

- Finding citations: [connected papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
- computer science bibliography: [dblp](https://www.google.com/search?q=dblp&oq=DBLP&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQgxOTg2ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=dblp%3A-,computer%20science%20bibliography,-DBLP)
  
## Reading an Article

### Before reading

- Examine the author
  - google
  - rewards ?
  - how well is the author cited

### Opening the piece

If at any point the article does not read relevant to the subject - break and find other articles.

Read in the following order:

1. Headings
2. Abstract & conclusion
3. References
4. Skim / Read through

(optional but recommended)

- recounstruct main arguments
- think about how you would change/improve the article
- write half a page summary + context
